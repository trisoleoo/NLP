# Natural Language Processing for Restaurant Reviews
This Project is to cluster reviews for a restaurant, and extract issues from the reviews
It solved this proble using 2 approaches:
1. Traditional approach: first conduct sentimental analysis to filter negative comments, then use LDA to find clusters, and analyze each topic to find issues.
2. LLM approach: directly feed all reviews to an LLM (llama 3) and asks the LLM to find issues

Boths approaches achieve similar results.
